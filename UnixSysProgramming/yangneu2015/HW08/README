GOALS: Find the maximum capacity the VM can run.

Steps:
1.	Open two VM as apache servers and install php5, and then create index.php file for each of them.
2.	Open VM as balancer and set the configuration file to make it connect to servers created before.
3.	Open VM as client to run a shell file which is a loop of curl so that it could continue connecting the balancer.
4.	Open multiple clients until the usage of server reach a bottleneck, like 100% CPU or 0 free memory.

Data:
The data below is the record of the number of clients and the usage of CPU and memory. (I use “top” to monitor the usage.)
We can see as the number of clients increasing, the usage of CPU will reach 100% but we still have a lot free memory. So the limit of this system is caused by CPU.

8             100          738756          100          747788        45
9             100          738220          100          747196        45
10            100          737288          100          745908        45

Result:
From the access.log file we could find the largest capacity is between line 1718 and 2213, which is 2213-1718+1=496/minute.
