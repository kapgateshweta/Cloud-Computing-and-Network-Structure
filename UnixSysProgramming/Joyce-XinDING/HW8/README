Some public IP address:
Server 1: http://52.27.242.147
Server 2: http://52.37.38.108
Load Balancer: http://52.33.112.243

Because Amazon AWS will change the public IP address if I shut down the instances, so I completed the homework also with another public IP address.
Load Balancer: http://52.38.33.178

Server 1 and Server 2 both has a index.php in the /var/www/html.
The client will access the index.php then get the response from server.

I wrote a file in the client to make unlimited request to the load balancer, and the load balancer will get response from Server 1 and Server 2.

Please see my assignment for more details.
