STEPS:
1. open one client (Let client VM to become a “connector” to connect with server) and two servers (two servers is in same VM, one’s job is to receive the connection from client, another is to count). 
2. get port from live_socket_srv.c in server. =>   vi live_socket_srv.c  =>  server.sin_port = htons( 8888 );
3. create a new shell scripts in client VM (connector.sh), to make a loop to connect with server again and again (use server ‘s IP 172.31.46.5 and receive port is 8888).
4. let server begin to waiting for connections  =>  ./live_socket_srv.o
5. use command  ps aux | grep live_socket_srv.o  to find out PID (6951).    
6. create a shell script named counter.sh, write a loop for counting.
7. run countor.sh in server.   chmod 777 counter.sh     sudo ./counter.sh
8. run connector.sh in client.   chmod 777 connector.sh     sudo ./connector.sh
9. final result, the max server capacity is 1021
