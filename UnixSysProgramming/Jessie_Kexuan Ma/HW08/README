server1 : http://172.31.26.116/ 
server2 : http://172.31.20.231/
load balancer : http://172.31.31.207/

1. client will connect with load balancer through script file -- connecter.sh
(there is a for loop inside the script file, it will send request through command: curl http://172.31.31.207/index.php every second )
2. load balancer's job is to let client to connect with server1 or server2 in random order.
3. then server1 or server2 receive the command and then run their big php file(index.php), it will consume memory.
4. in order to find out which is the limit of this system, I begin to open more and more client.
5. every time I open a new client and run the connecter.sh, I need to use "vmstat 3" command in every server to find out the usage of CPU, Memory and IO 
6. besides in load balancer use the command 'sudo netstat -anp | grep apache2 | wc -l' to get the number of connections to apache2.
7. in load balancer, use the log file 'access.log' to calculate the access number every minute on one server.


This is the record of usage of cpu, memory and connection on the server:
                          Server1                  Server2
Number of Client     %CPU      Free_Mem        %CPU      Free_Mem         Number_of_connections

According to the experimental data above, the CPU will reach to the maximum capacity first, the free memory is also descending.
According to the access.log, the maximum access number every minute is about 203 on one server.
