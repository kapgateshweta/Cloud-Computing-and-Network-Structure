balancer public IP: http://52.38.123.237

Balcancer will forward request to server1 and server2 and server3 alternately.

server1 private IP: http://172.31.32.110 

server2 private IP: http://172.31.45.93

server3 private IP: http://172.31.39.176

server1, server2 and server3 all has the msgsrv application and load-engima.
The client will access the load.php then get the response from server.
The load.php will load the CPU. The client will run a script like a while loop of curl to load the server.

clientX.sh is the script of client to load the server. It uses curl -I to get the header information of 
response from server and record this information in the file clientX.log.

clientX.log is the log file to record the header information of response from server. 
If one of the server is shutdown, the response of this query will be different(not like HTTP/1.1 200 OK). 
And the script will record the time of each response.

In the experiment, I had client1.sh to client5.sh and client1.log to client5.log. Because I need 5 clients to 
load three servers to keep the usage of cpu to 60%~80%.

Below are my experiment process: 

1. 
First, to make the balancer to balance two application instances and there are three clients are loading the server 
and the usage of CPU of these servers are about 70%. 
 
We can get the access number per minute of each server and balancer.
 
     Time             server1     server2     server3     balancer
01/Apr/2016_05_02     2193.25     2183.18     0           3193.57
01/Apr/2016_05_03     2128.87     2128.75     0           3124.03
01/Apr/2016_05_04     2166.17     2138.18     0           3153.83
01/Apr/2016_05_05     2124.63     2155.9      0           3106.65
01/Apr/2016_05_06     2189.22     2179.1      0	          3188.6
01/Apr/2016_05_07     2145.92     2159.45     0	          3143.9
01/Apr/2016_05_08     2166.15     2162.05     0	          3158.8

2.
Then, I added the third server to the balancer. And the usage of CPU of three servers are about 46%. 

    Time              server1     server2     server3     balancer
01/Apr/2016_05_10     1441.62     1441.62     1431.43     3153.83
01/Apr/2016_05_11     1426.32     1430.27     1437.17     3151.35
01/Apr/2016_05_12     1431.5      1427.32     1420.53     3121.55

3.
I added two clients to load the server so that the usage of CPU of three servers can reach 70%.
And the access number of balancer also increased.

    Time              server1     server2     server3     balancer
01/Apr/2016_05_14     2240.98     2245.72     2247.37     4919.48
01/Apr/2016_05_15     2266.95     2258.78     2257.2      4969.15
01/Apr/2016_05_16     2282.98     2292.5      2285.13     5011.37
01/Apr/2016_05_17     2262.53     2253.83     2269.35     4981.57
01/Apr/2016_05_18     2250.02     2248.07     2252        4949.28
01/Apr/2016_05_19     2256.6      2265.3      2256.47     4951.77
01/Apr/2016_05_20     2207.55     2213.92     2211.28     4847.47
01/Apr/2016_05_21     1897.43     2283.13     2274.13     4832.3


4.
Then I shutdown server1 for about two minutes and then restart it and to observe the impact on behave of service.
We can see the performance on access number of server:

    Time              server1     server2     server3     balancer
01/Apr/2016_05_22     0           2200.27     2213.65     3235.78
01/Apr/2016_05_23     0           2203.87     2203.67     3223.37
01/Apr/2016_05_24     329.967     2199.83     2198.17     3352.5
01/Apr/2016_05_25     2257.6      2261.33     2256        4954.25
01/Apr/2016_05_26     2224.57     2227.58     2219.78     4877.27
01/Apr/2016_05_27     2216.97     2212.87     2222.75     4882.23
01/Apr/2016_05_28     2229.53     2229.55     2225.23     4874.78


5.
Second time, I shutdown the server2 and restart it. I got the similar result:

    Time              server1     server2     server3     balancer
01/Apr/2016_05_33     2162.88     206.75      2179.1      3538.35
01/Apr/2016_05_34     2145.22     0           2145.9      3148.87
01/Apr/2016_05_35     2130.82     0           2122.98     3104.17
01/Apr/2016_05_36     2220.63     1999.37     2224        4509.73
01/Apr/2016_05_37     2251.75     2246.87     2248.42     4939.35
01/Apr/2016_05_38     2263.25     2260.08     2268.72     4971.63
01/Apr/2016_05_39     2227.48     2224.65     2218.57     4869.82
01/Apr/2016_05_40     2230        2246.87     2236.85     4919.48
01/Apr/2016_05_41     2221.75     2211.85     2221.82     4884.72

And we might find one or two responses like 'HTTP/1.1 502 Proxy Error' in the clientX.log .
The content of file:

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Fri, 01 Apr 2016 05:21:45 GMT
HTTP/1.1 502 Proxy Error
Date: Fri, 01 Apr 2016 05:21:53 GMT
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Fri, 01 Apr 2016 05:21:54 GMT

When we shutdown the server, client may get a information '502 Proxy Error', 
because the balancer can't get the response from this server.


Finally, we can see the process of changing on line graph. LineGraph.jpg
We get the experimental result that 
(1) When we shutdown one server, the access number of balancer will reduce by about %30;
(2) When we shutdown one server, the access number of other servers will reduce by about 4.5% .

So, the impact on the user behave is not slight when one server shutdown for a while.
But if the server is just restart, the impact is not very big.
And other servers would not be impact heavily.
